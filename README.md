## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeatherMap API

This weather app uses:
- **HTML** for the basic structure  
- **CSS** for layout, responsiveness, and styling  
- **JavaScript** for API fetching, DOM updates, and showing weather info  
- **Fetch API + async/await** to get real-time weather data  

**Main Features:**
- Live temperature display  
- Humidity and wind speed  
- Weather icons based on conditions  
- Error handling for invalid city names  
- Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop  


## Optimizations

- Improved error handling using `try/catch`  
- Used async/await for cleaner API calls  
- Organized JS code into modular functions  
- Added responsive styling for better mobile experience  


## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I improved my API handling skills, practiced asynchronous JavaScript using async/await, and learned how to manage errors smoothly. I also gained experience in designing responsive UIs using CSS Flexbox and Grid.

This project strengthened my understanding of how to integrate APIs into real-time, interactive web applications.
